# Predicting Housing Prices Using Supervised Machine Learning with Python

In this regression project, I built a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices based on a variety of features.

## Situation

Similar to my other project documented in the repository `housing-value-classification-supervised-ml-python`, this project uses a dataset of historical home prices in Ames, Iowa. The goal here is to build a regression model that predicts the actual sale price of a home based on characteristics such as garage size, year built, building type, and more.

This project was part of a regression competition on Kaggle, where models were evaluated against actual housing prices using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The final model I submitted achieved an RMSE of **28,454.19** and a Kaggle score of **0.13481**.

## Approach

After gaining a better understanding of the housing market and identifying the most impactful features for pricing, I explored and preprocessed the data.

To evaluate performance, I used several regression metrics:  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  
- R-squared (RÂ²)

I trained and evaluated the following regression models using scikit-learn:  
- `GradientBoostingRegressor`  
- `RandomForestRegressor`  
- `LinearRegression`  
- `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`  
- `Lasso`  
- `BayesianRidge`

For feature selection, I experimented with:  
- Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)  
- Variance Threshold  
- SelectKBest

The best results were achieved using the `GradientBoostingRegressor`, in combination with RFECV (using `GradientBoostingRegressor` as the estimator), Variance Threshold (set to 0), and hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`.
